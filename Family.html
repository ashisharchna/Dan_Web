<p> This is my family. I have a mom and a dad, named Kelly and Jim, along with a 13 year old little brother named Mike. He's in the seventh grade. I love my family and they love me back. We enjoy going on vacation together and having fun together. My little brother likes computers too, and is interested in taking a computers class in high school too. </p>
