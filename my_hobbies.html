		<h1> My Top 3 Hobbies </h1>
		<ol>
		<li> Football </li> <p> I like football a lot because it's fun and gives me something to do. Our team might not be the best but I love playing it and my teammates are fun to be around. It's fun because we usually mess around a lot in practice and practice is usually pretty easy. August is hard becuase practice is everyday besides Sunday from August 15 to our first game. I hope this year I can play some more runningback because I find that my favorite thing to do. </p>
		<li> Playing Video Games </li> <p> I like playing video games because it helps me relax and allows me to have fun after a school day and track. I usually play on Xbox. </p>
		<li> Track </li> <p> I like doing track too because it gets my speed up for football and gives me something to do. It's fun to just hang out with friends on the track. I'm not the best at it but I'm getting better.
